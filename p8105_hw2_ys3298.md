From the data, we can notice that the total precipitations for 2014-2018
are 51.59, 43.21, 39.95, 32.93 and 23.5 respectively, which decrease
year by year. The median numbers of sports balls in a dumpster in
2014-2018 are 6, 16, 26, 8, 3. The mean numbers of plastic bottle in a
dumpster in 2014-2018 are 1540, 1960, 2980, 2260, 995. The mean numbers
of grocery bags in 2014-2018 are 880, 1392, 2292, 1939, 676. From these
data, we can easily noticed that the number of sports balls, plastic
bottle and grocery bags firstly increased and then decrease from 2014 to
2018.

In the pols\_month dataset, there are 9 variables related to the number
of national politicians who are democratic or republican at any given
time. **prez** means president, **gov** means governors, **sen** means
senators, **rep** means representatives and **gop** means republican,
**dem** means democratic. File “snp” contains 2 variables related to
Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S\&P), often used as a
representative measure of stock market as a whole. “Unemployment” shows
percentage of unemployment in each month of the associated year. After
we merge snp, pols and unemploy, we get a (1391, 12) dataset. We can
clearly see what party the president is, how many governors in each
party, how many unemployment and what’s the Standard & Poor’s stock
market index in each month from 1947 to 2015.
